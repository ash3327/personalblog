            <p>
              Hi! I'm Sam, an AI enthusiast and app developer, currently in my final year at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
            </p>
            <p>
              My experience primarily revolves around Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I actively engage in working on personal projects and regularly read research papers in the field. I also have some experience in Java and am eager to learn new skills as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m always excited to embrace new challenges and contribute to innovative projects in AI and backend development.
            </p>
