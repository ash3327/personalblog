# Audio Encoding

* Masking
  * Amplitude (Loud noise covers soft sound, competing)
  * Temporal (Time range of few millisecs, louder event happens BEFORE softer event then softer event may not be heard (inverse not true))
  * Frequency

## MP3
* Divide into frames, apply MDCT filter, then do 1024-point FFT
