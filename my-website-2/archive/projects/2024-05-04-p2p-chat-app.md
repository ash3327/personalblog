<!--truncate-->

## Project Overview

This P2P chat application demonstrates the power of browser-based peer-to-peer communication using WebRTC technology. Users can create chat rooms and communicate directly with each other without a central server.

## Key Features

- Direct peer-to-peer messaging
- Real-time text chat
- No central server required
- End-to-end encryption
- Room creation and joining
- File sharing capabilities

## Technology Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- WebRTC
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js (signaling server)

## Implementation Details

The application uses WebRTC's data channels for direct communication between peers. A minimal signaling server helps with the initial connection setup.

## Code Highlights

```typescript
const initializePeerConnection = async (roomId: string) => {
  const pc = new RTCPeerConnection(configuration);
  const dataChannel = pc.createDataChannel('chat');
  
  dataChannel.onmessage = handleMessage;
  dataChannel.onopen = handleChannelOpen;
  
  return pc;
};
```

## Future Enhancements

- Video chat capabilities
- Screen sharing
- Multiple room support
- Improved UI/UX
- Mobile responsiveness
